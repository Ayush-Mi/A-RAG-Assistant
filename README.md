# A-RAG Assistant

A-RAG Assistant is a chatbot application built with Python, utilizing the `transformers` library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is designed to provide intelligent responses based on a pre-trained model and a custom dataset.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat window for real-time conversations.
- **Custom Dataset**: Integrates with a pre-defined dataset to provide relevant responses.
- **Transformers Integration**: Leverages state-of-the-art models from the `transformers` library for NLP tasks.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Mi/A-RAG-Assistant.git
   cd A-RAG-Assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Models and Datasets:**

   Ensure you have the necessary pre-trained models and datasets. The repository should include instructions or scripts for downloading them if needed.

## Usage

To run the chatbot application:

1. **Start the Chat Interface:**

   Execute the following command to launch the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Chatbot:**

   Open the application, enter your queries, and interact with the chatbot. The chatbot will use the pre-trained model to generate responses based on your input.
